The force required to hold this block in equilibrium so a block of mass ten k g is sitting on an inclined plane of angle thirty degrees so this angle here is thirty degrees if i have a force f being exerted at a distance d if d equal to half a meter what is f for equilibrium okay so we're going to try to go through and understand how to solve this problem so the first concept that we have to understand
