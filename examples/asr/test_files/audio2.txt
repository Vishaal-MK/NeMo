hello welcome to noise management and its control today is the first day of this course
this is a twelve week course ah total number of lecture hours will be around thirty hours
of lecture material each week we will have six lectures starting from monday to saturday
and at the end of this each week you will be expected to complete an assignment which
will test you on the concepts which we would cover on a weekly basis and at the end of
the course you would be expected to take an exam and if you do good in that exam then
you will be eligible for a certificate in the course
this is a highly application oriented course and in this course we will be covering a gamut
of things particularly from ah the standpoint of view or from the standpoint of applications
so if you are working in a car industry or you are interested in noise vibrations and
harshness related analysis or you are working in developing systems you know air conditioning
h back systems where lot of air flows through the through large buildings and you are not
only interested in cooling the building but also ensuring that when air is passing through
these h ver[tex]- noise is ah controlled or if you are interested in noise cancellation
then perhaps this would be a course which you will find to be useful
ah what i plan to do today is give you some details about this course and the actual course
material and the lecture material will actually start from tomorrow so today we will just
get an over view of the course and that's what we plan to do so specifically this week
we will be doing a lot of concepts what is decibel what are different units of sound
what are different terminology is associated with sound so those are some of the important
things which you will learn ah at least during this week
starting next week we will start addressing some of the important concepts in context
of sound because understanding of these concepts is important if you want to be good in acoustics
and especially in noise control so some of the important concepts we will address will
be what is a linear system ah another important concept would ah what is a transfer function
then we will do a quick review of complex algebra both in a plus b ii a format and also
eulerian format where you express complex numbers as ah a times exponent ah i times
theta so that is what we plan to do ah in the next week some of the important concepts
then in the third week we what we plan to do is we will start developing some very important
equations which govern sound and its propagation so essentially we will learn about the mechanics
of sound waves ah a lot of times if the sound waves are propagating in one dimensional are
one direction in nature that is they are propagating only in a particular direction then they are
governed by one dimensional sound propagation equation
so we will develop that equation and we will try to solve that equation in that week and
then we will continue that discussion on the fourth week as well but in reality it's not
too many of times that sounds just travels in a particular direction rather sound travels
in all directions so if i have a source of sound it travels typically ah radially outwards
so in the fifth week and part of the sixth we will cover the mechanics of spherically
propagating sound waves so that ah we will give us some good amount of grounding in the
science of acoustics and then we will start talking about noise so six week onwards we
will learn how is noise measured ah what kind of instruments do we use what are the important
considerations we have to worry about while we are doing noise measurement then in the
seventh week we will start discussing what kind of different sources are there in terms
of noise so we may have a point source we may have
a line source we have may have a planar source of noise we may have an ah you know three
dimensional or a spherical noise source so different types of noise sources how do i
how do we identify them and what are some special properties of some of these resources
and this is an important area of understanding at least in context of this course so we will
extend this discussion over a period of two weeks that is up to eighth week and then in
the ninth week onwards we will start learning how do we reduce noise in a structured quantifiable
way so there are international standards ah which
are used to reduce which are used in context of noise reduction and noise measurement so
we learn about different acoustic criteria ah when we are trying to manage noise and
then we will start applying some of these concepts for different applications for instance
suppose you are sitting in a room and you want to ensure that the noise or the listening
in that room is of good qualities so suppose it's a very large room may be an
auditorium and if it's a poorly designed auditorium then you can have a lot of echoes which in
engineering terms are known as reverberations so if those reverberations are there then
you tend to don't get a clear cognition or perception of sound and how do you solve that
problem using simple tools simple methods so that is something we will learn
so we will talk about room acoustics then we will also learn the mathematics and the
practical aspects of silencers so that is another tool which is used to reduce sound
we use this silencers ah in lot of automobiles but not only in automobiles but in motorcycles
tractors and even in other places for instance in gen sets where we use engines to generate
electricity we reduce if it want to reduce the noise coming out of it we use silencers
so how do silencers work those another thing we will learn and then another thing we will
learn in the second last week of this course will be how do we isolate sound so sound can
get gets propagated in several ways one is that suppose i am speaking some directly reaches
and it propagates in all directions in other cases what happens is that when someone
is speaking that sound goes and hits a particular structure maybe it's a sheet metal and then
that sheet metal starts vibrating so and on the other side of the sheet metal if there
is a person listening then he will hear the noise because of those vibrations so it is
important in such cases that we are able to reduce the vibration of the structure so if
we are able to reduce vibrations in the structure then it will help us to reduce the noise which
is propagated due to those vibrations that kind of a noise is known as vibro acoustic
noise so how to be reduce vibrations and how do
we isolate vibrations and then we will do several case studies ah where we will look
at some of the practical examples of noise and see how those pro in those practical applications
reduce we were able to reduce noise to acceptable levels so that is the overall scheme of this
course and all of you are welcome there are no specific prerequisites for this course
but i think it will be useful ah that if you particularly have a degree either in physics
or in any area of engineering doesn't matter it can be mechanical or electrical or civil
then it will be a little bit easier for you at the in terms of understanding whatever
we are talking about in part this particular course
so i hope that gives you an overview of this course and i look forward to having you in
this course over a period of next twelve weeks ah couple of other important things there
are three or four ah tutors or teaching assistants assigned to this course so if you have questions
you are welcome to approach these tas and ask your questions please do not hesitate
to ask those questions at all if they are unable to address some of your questions for
whatever reasons then you are also welcome to approach me all the contact details are
provided on the website about this course so you are welcome to ah answer you know approach
us in ah this particular regard so i hope this gives you an overview and i look forward
to seeing you starting tomorrow ah and i hope you have a pleasant and ah positive learning
experience ah over the period this course thank you
